## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest while End-to-End (E2E) Testing is conducted by Playwright.

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
pnpm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
pnpm run test:unit:coverage
```

All unit tests run in watch mode by default. If you'd like to disable watch mode, change the package.json test scripts with the following

before:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest unit",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest --coverage unit"
}
```
